## Overview
This is a simple task management app. The application allows you to add tasks, mark those that are finished and delete them.
Pracowity.Space helped me to practice functions and HTML rendering with JavaScript.
One of the most difficult functionalities was generating the application view so that the button would show an emote and add the appropriate text-decoration.
